# Abstract
Foreground-background segmentation is a crucial aspect of photography, enabling the creation of visually appealing images. Background subtraction techniques are widely used to isolate the subject, enhancing the composition and focus of the photograph. This paper explores a novel approach introduced in recent versions of OpenCV for efficient background subtraction. These algorithms are pivotal in training robust machine learning models for automated background removal, facilitating applications like portrait mode effects and video processing. By leveraging advancements in computer vision, this study highlights the significance of accurate background subtraction for improving image quality and achieving professional results in both photography and computational imaging.
